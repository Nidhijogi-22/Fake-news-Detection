üì∞ Fake News Detection using LSTM and Traditional Machine Learning Models

** üìå Overview **
This project aims to detect fake news articles using both **deep learning** and **traditional machine learning** approaches. It compares the performance of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks with algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, **Naive Bayes**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Decision trees** , and **Random Forest**.

The study highlights the strengths of sequential models like LSTM in capturing contextual patterns in text, and evaluates them against baseline ML models for performance metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
